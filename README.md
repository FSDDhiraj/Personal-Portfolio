‚öôÔ∏è D-Folio: Dhiraj's Cyberpunk Portfolio
"Code. Create. Innovate."

A dynamic and visually stunning personal portfolio showcasing my expertise as a MERN Stack Developer. Designed with a sleek, high-tech, cyberpunk aesthetic, this site uses creative CSS and JavaScript to bring my skills and projects to life.

‚ú® Features
High-Tech & Immersive Design
Cyberpunk Theme: A cohesive dark theme utilizing neon accents (#64ffda - Teal) for a modern, futuristic feel.

Animated Hero Section: Features a mesmerizing Matrix-style rain effect, floating code snippets, and an interactive terminal window with a typing effect.
